# COVID-19 Dashboard for Canada

I build this dashboard to better understand the situation of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada. It is made by pure python thanks for [dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). I also deployed it to Heroku (https://wayneyin-covid19-dashboard.herokuapp.com/). 

All data come from the official website of the [Public Health Department of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html). Though the government has its official [dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/2f1a13ca0b29422f9b34660f0b705043/), my dashboard provide more detail about test number and the news about COVID-19 in Canada. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any question.
